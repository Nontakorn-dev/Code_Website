## Introduction  

FetalBrain applies **artificial intelligence** to analyze fetal brain ultrasound images, helping doctors detect potential abnormalities with high precision. By leveraging **deep learning-based image segmentation and classification**, this project aims to provide an accessible and reliable screening tool.

## Key Features  

- **AI-based Ultrasound Image Analysis**: Detects and classifies fetal brain abnormalities.  
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses CNN architectures for feature extraction and classification.  
- **Cloud-based Web Application**: Enables remote access and easy deployment.  
- **Fast and Accurate Predictions**: Provides real-time results for clinical decision-making.  

## Usage  

1. Upload an **ultrasound image** of the fetal brain.  
2. The AI model processes and classifies the image.  
3. View **real-time analysis** and **risk predictions**.  
4. Save and review previous scan results.  

## Awards & Recognition  

FetalBrain received the **Silver Award** at the **International Students Research Fair (ISRF) 2024**, hosted by the Science Association of Indonesia (SAID).
